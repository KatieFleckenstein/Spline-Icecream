# Spline-Icecream
A colourful icecream cone with a sneaky dribble.
When I first saw the shape blend how-to on Spline, I immediately thought of an ice cream cone dribbling on a hot summer day. To bring this vision to life, I started by building the base, using a cone 3D shape with two "scoops" on top made of spheres. Next, I added colour. I wanted the ice cream to be fun and whimsical, the kind of colours parents don't want their kids to have, so I went with cotton candy colours. When adding the top "scoop," I inserted a shape blend sphere, duplicated it for the dribbles, and sized it so that it did not look astronomically huge when the scoop and dribbles were combined. The cherry on top was literally just adding the cherry on top once all of the scoops were stacked and the colours completed. The hardest part of making this ice cream cone was making the shape blend square large enough so that the dribbles could reach all the way to the bottom of the cone, but that was a quick fix. Other challenges I faced were making the top scoop small enough so that it would "fit" on the other ones while still having the dripples and making dribbles fall fast enough before re-blobbing. I enjoyed exploring Spline, and although I got lost in the 3d space quite a lot, accidentally turning my cone or making shapes in the wrong dimension, I am looking forward to making more 3d animations using it.
