# Spline-Icecream
A colourful icecream cone with a sneaky dribble.
When I first saw the shape blend how-to on Spline, I immediately thought of an ice cream cone dribbling on a hot summer day. To bring this vision to life, I started by building the base, using a cone 3D shape with two "scoops" on top made of spheres. Next I added colour. I wanted the icecream to be fun and whimsical, the kind that parents don't want their kids to have, so I went with cotton candy colours. When adding the top "scoop," I inserted a shape blend spere and duplicated it for the dribbles and sized it so that when the scoop and dribbles were combined, it did not look astronomically huge. The cherry on top was literally just adding the cherry on top once all of the scoops were stacked and the colours competed. The hardest part of making this ice cream cone was making the shape blend square large enough so that the dribbles could reach all the way to the bottom of the cone, but that was a quick fix. I enjoyed exploring spline, and although I got lost in the 3D space quite a lot, accidentally turning my cone or making shapes in the wrong dimension, I am looking forward to making more 3D animations using it.
